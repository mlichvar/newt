<para>
The <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> windowing system is a terminal-based window and widget
library designed for writing applications with a simple, but user-friendly,
interface. While <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> is not intended to provide the rich feature
set advanced applications may require, it has proven to be flexible enough
for a wide range of applications (most notably, Red Hat's installation
process). This tutorial explains the design philosophy behind <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> and
how to use <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> from your programs.

<sect1><title>Introduction</title>

<para>
<literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> has a definite design philosophy behind it, and knowing that design
makes it significantly easier to craft robust <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> applications. This
tutorial documents <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> 0.30 --- older versions of <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> had
annoying inconsistencies in it (which writing this tutorial pointed out),
which were removed while this tutorial was written. The latest version of
<literal remap="tt">newt</literal> is always available from Red Hat.</para>

<sect2><title>Background</title>

<para>
<literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> was originally designed for use in the install code for
Red Hat Linux. As this install code runs in an environment with limited
resources (most importantly limited filesystem space), <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>'s size
was immediately an issue. To help minimize its size, the following design
decisions were made early in its implementation:

 <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> does not use an event-driven architecture.

<para>
 <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> is written in C, not C++. While there has been interest
in constructing C++ wrapper classes around the <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> API, nothing has
yet come of those ideas.</para>

<para>
 Windows must be created and destroyed as a stack (in other words, all
<literal remap="tt">newt</literal> windows behave as modal dialogs). This is probably
the greatest functionality restriction of <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>.</para>

<para>
While <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> provides a complete API, it does not handle the low-level
screen drawing itself. Instead, <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> is layered on top of the screen
management capabilities of John E. Davis's 
<ulink url="ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang/">S-Lang</ulink> library.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Designing <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> applications</title>
<para>
As <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> is not event driven and forces modal windows (forcing window
order to behave like a stack), newt applications tend to look quite like
other text-mode programs. It is quite straightforward to convert a command
line program which uses simple user prompts into a <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> application.
Some of the programs run as part of the Red Hat installation process
(such as <literal remap="tt">Xconfigurator</literal> and <literal remap="tt">mouseconfig</literal>) were originally written
as simple terminal mode programs which used line-oriented menus to get
input from the user and were later converted into <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> applications
(through a process affectionately known as newtering). Such a conversion
does not require changes to the control flow of most applications.

Programming <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> is dramatically different from writing programs for
most other windowing systems as <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>'s API is not event driven. This
means that <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> applications look dramatically different from programs
written for event-driven architectures such as Motif, <literal remap="tt">gtk</literal>, or even
Borland's old TurboVision libraries.

When you're designing your <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> program, keep this differentiation
in mind. As long as you plan your application to call a function to
get input and then continue (rather then having your program called
when input is ready), programming with the newt libraries should be
simple.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Components</title>

<para>
Displayable items in <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> are known as <emphasis remap="bf">components</emphasis>, which are
analogous to the widgets provided by most Unix widget sets. There are
two main types of components in <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>, forms and everything else.
Forms logically group components into functional sets. When an application
is ready to get input from a user, it ``runs a form'', which makes the
form active and lets the user enter information into the components the
form contains. A form may contain any other component, including other
forms. Using subforms in this manner lets the application change the details
of how the user tabs between components on the form, scroll regions of the
screen, and control background colors for portions of windows.

Every component is of type <literal remap="tt">newtComponent</literal>, which is an opaque type. It's
guaranteed to be a pointer though, which lets applications move it through
void pointers if the need arises. Variables of type <literal remap="tt">newtComponent</literal> should
never be directly manipulated -- they should only be passed to <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>
functions. As <literal remap="tt">newtComponent</literal> variables are pointers, remember that
they are always passed by value -- if you pass a <literal remap="tt">newtComponent</literal> to
a function which manipulates it, that component is manipulated everywhere,
not just inside of that function (which is nearly always the behaviour
you want).</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Conventions</title>

<para>
<literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> uses a number of conventions to make it easier for programmers
to use. 


<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
 All functions which manipulate data structures take the data
structure being modified as their first parameter. For example, all
of the functions which manipulate forms expect the <literal remap="tt">newtComponent</literal>
for that form to be the first parameter.</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 As <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> is loosely typed (forcing all of the components into
a single variable makes coding easier, but nullifies the value of type
checking), <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> functions include the name of the type they are
manipulating. An example of this is <literal remap="tt">newtFormAddComponent()</literal>, which
adds a component to a form. Note that the first parameter to this function
is a form, as the name would suggest.</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 When screen coordinates are passed into a function, the 
x location precedes the y location. To help keep this clear,
we'll use the words ``left'' and ``top'' to describe those indicators (with
left corresponding to the x position).</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 When box sizes are passed, the horizontal width precedes the vertical
width.</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 When both a screen location and a box size are being passed, the
screen location precedes the box size.</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 When any component other then a form is created, the first two
parameters are always the (left, right) location.</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 Many functions take a set of flags as the final parameter. These
flags may be logically ORed together to pass more then one flag at a time.</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
 <literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> uses <emphasis remap="bf">callback</emphasis> functions to convey certain events to
the application. While callbacks differ slightly in their parameters, most
of them allow the application to specify an arbitrary argument to be passed
to the callback when the callback is invoked. This argument is always a 
<literal remap="tt">void *</literal>, which allows the application great flexibility.
</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para></sect2></sect1>



<sect1><title>Basic <literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> Functions</title>

<para>
While most <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> functions are concerned with widgets or groups
of widgets (called grids and forms), some parts of the <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> API
deal with more global issues, such as initializing <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> or writing
to the root window.</para>


<sect2><title>Starting and Ending <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> Services</title>

<para>
There are three functions which nearly every <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> application use. The
first two are used to initialize the system.


<screen>
int newtInit(void);
void newtCls(void);
</screen>


<literal remap="tt">newtInit()</literal> should be the first function called by every <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>
program. It initializes internal data structures and places the terminal
in raw mode. Most applications invoke <literal remap="tt">newtCls()</literal> immediately after
<literal remap="tt">newtInit()</literal>, which causes the screen to be cleared. It's not
necessary to call <literal remap="tt">newtCls()</literal> to use any of <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>'s features, but
doing so will normally give a much neater appearance.

When a <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> program is ready to exit, it should call <literal remap="tt">newtFinished()</literal>.


<screen>
int newtFinished(void);
</screen>


<literal remap="tt">newtFinished()</literal> restores the terminal to its appearance when
<literal remap="tt">newtInit()</literal> was called (if possible -- on some terminals the cursor will
be moved to the bottom, but it won't be possible to remember the original
terminal contents) and places the terminal in its original input state.
If this function isn't called, the terminal will probably need to be
reset with the <literal remap="tt">reset</literal> command before it can be used easily.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Handling Keyboard Input</title>

<para>
Normally, <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> programs don't read input directly from the
user. Instead, they let <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> read the input and hand it to the
program in a semi-digested form. <literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> does provide a couple of simple
functions which give programs (a bit of) control over the terminal.


<screen>
void newtWaitForKey(void);
void newtClearKeyBuffer(void);
</screen></para>



<para>
The first of these, <literal remap="tt">newtWaitForKey()</literal>, doesn't return until a key
has been pressed. The keystroke is then ignored. If a key is already in
the terminal's buffer, <literal remap="tt">newtWaitForKey()</literal> discards a keystroke and
returns immediately.

<literal remap="tt">newtClearKeyBuffer()</literal> discards the contents of the terminal's input
buffer without waiting for additional input.</para></sect2> 


<sect2><title>Drawing on the Root Window</title>

<para>
The background of the terminal's display (the part without any windows 
covering it) is known as the <emphasis remap="bf">root window</emphasis> (it's the parent of all
windows, just like the system's root directory is the parent of all 
subdirectories). Normally, applications don't use the root window, instead
drawing all of their text inside of windows (<literal remap="tt">newt</literal> doesn't require
this though -- widgets may be placed directly on the root window without
difficulty). It is often desirable to display some text, such as a
program's name or copyright information, on the root window, however.
<literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> provides two ways of displaying text on the root window. These
functions may be called at any time. They are the only <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> functions
which are meant to write outside of the current window.


<screen>
void newtDrawRootText(int left, int top, const char * text);
</screen></para>



<para>
This function is straightforward. It displays the string <literal remap="tt">text</literal> at
the position indicated. If either the <literal remap="tt">left</literal> or <literal remap="tt">top</literal> is
negative, the position is measured from the opposite side of the
screen. The final measurement will seem to be off by one though. For
example, a <literal remap="tt">top</literal> of -1 indicates the last line on the screen, and
one of -2 is the line above that.

As it's common to use the last line on the screen to display help information,
<literal remap="tt">newt</literal> includes special support for doing exactly that. The last
line on the display is known as the <emphasis remap="bf">help line</emphasis>, and is treated as a
stack. As the value of the help line normally relates to the window
currently displayed, using the same structure for window order and the
help line is very natural. Two functions are provided to manipulate the
help line.


<screen>
void newtPushHelpLine(const char * text);
void newtPopHelpLine(void);
</screen>


The first function, <literal remap="tt">newtPushHelpLine()</literal>, saves the current help line
on a stack (which is independent of the window stack) and displays the
new line. If <literal remap="tt">text</literal> is <literal remap="tt">NULL</literal>, <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>'s default help line is
displayed (which provides basic instructions on using <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>). If
<literal remap="tt">text</literal> is a string of length 0, the help line is cleared. For all
other values of <literal remap="tt">text</literal>, the passed string is displayed at the bottom,
left-hand corner of the display. The space between the end of the displayed
string the the right-hand edge of the terminal is cleared.

<literal remap="tt">newtPopHelpLine()</literal> replaces the current help line with the one it
replaced. It's important not to call tt/newtPopHelpLine()/ more then
<literal remap="tt">newtPushHelpLine()</literal>!

<literal remap="tt">Suspending Newt Applications</literal>

By default, <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> programs cannot be suspended by the user (compare
this to most Unix programs which can be suspended by pressing the suspend
key (normally <literal remap="tt">^Z</literal>).  Instead, programs can specify a <emphasis remap="bf">callback</emphasis>
function which gets invoked when the user presses the suspend key. 


<screen>
typedef void (*newtSuspendCallback)(void);

void newtSetSuspendCallback(newtSuspendCallback cb);
</screen>


The suspend function neither expects nor returns any value, and can
do whatever it likes to when it is invoked. If no suspend callback
is registered, the suspend keystroke is ignored.

If the application should suspend and continue like most user applications,
the suspend callback needs two other <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> functions.


<screen>
void newtSuspend(void);
void newtResume(void);
</screen>


<literal remap="tt">newtSuspend()</literal> tells <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> to return the terminal to its initial
state. Once this is done, the application can suspend itself (by
sending itself a <literal remap="tt">SIGTSTP</literal>, fork a child program, or do whatever
else it likes. When it wants to resume using the <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> interface,
it must call <literal remap="tt">newtResume</literal> before doing so. 

Note that suspend callbacks are not signal handlers. When <literal remap="tt">newtInit()</literal>
takes over the terminal, it disables the part of the terminal interface
which sends the suspend signal. Instead, if <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> sees the suspend
keystroke during normal input processing, it immediately calls the suspend
callback if one has been set. This means that suspending newt applications
is not asynchronous.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Refreshing the Screen</title>

<para>
To increase performance, S-Lang only updates the display when it needs
to, not when the program tells S-Lang to write to the terminal. ``When it
needs to'' is implemented as ``right before the we wait for the user to
press a key''. While this allows for optimized screen displays most of
the time, this optimization makes things difficult for programs which
want to display progress messages without forcing the user to input 
characters. Applications can force S-Lang to immediately update modified
portions of the screen by calling <literal remap="tt">newtRefresh</literal>.


<orderedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
The program wants to display a progress message, without forcing
for the user to enter any characters.</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
A misfeature of the program causes part of the screen to be
corrupted. Ideally, the program would be fixed, but that may not 
always be practical.
</para>
</listitem></orderedlist>
</para></sect2>



<sect2><title>Other Miscellaneous Functions</title>

<para>
As always, some function defy characterization. Two of <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>'s general
function fit this oddball category.


<screen>
void newtBell(void);
void newtGetScreenSize(int * cols, int * rows);
</screen>


The first sends a beep to the terminal. Depending on the terminal's
settings, this been may or may not be audible. The second function,
<literal remap="tt">newtGetScreenSize()</literal>, fills in the passed pointers with the
current size of the terminal.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Basic <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> Example</title>

<para>
To help illustrate the functions presented in this section here is a short
sample <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> program which uses many of them. While it doesn't do
anything interesting, it does show the basic structure of <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> programs.


<screen>
#include &#60;newt.h&#62;
#include &#60;stdlib.h&#62;

int main(void) {
    newtInit();
    newtCls();

    newtDrawRootText(0, 0, "Some root text");
    newtDrawRootText(-25, -2, "Root text in the other corner");

    newtPushHelpLine(NULL);
    newtRefresh();
    sleep(1);

    newtPushHelpLine("A help line");
    newtRefresh();
    sleep(1);

    newtPopHelpLine();
    newtRefresh();
    sleep(1);

    newtFinished();
}
</screen></para></sect2></sect1>



<sect1><title>Windows</title>

<para>
While most <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> applications do use windows, <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>'s window
support is actually extremely limited. Windows must be destroyed in the
opposite of the order they were created, and only the topmost window may be
active. Corollaries to this are:


<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
The user may not switch between windows.</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
Only the top window may be destroyed.
</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>

While this is quite a severe limitation, adopting it greatly simplifies
both writing <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> applications and developing <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> itself, as it
separates <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> from the world of event-driven programming. However,
this tradeoff between function and simplicity may make <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>
unsuitable for some tasks.
</para>

<sect2><title>Creating Windows</title>

<para>
There are two main ways of opening <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> windows: with or without
explicit sizings. When grids (which will be introduced later in this
tutorial) are used, a window may be made to just fit the grid. When
grids are not used, explicit sizing must be given.


<screen>
int newtCenteredWindow(int width, int height, const char * title);
int newtOpenWindow(int left, int top, int width, int height, 
		   const char * title);
</screen>


The first of these functions open a centered window of the specified
size. The <literal remap="tt">title</literal> is optional -- if it is <literal remap="tt">NULL</literal>, then no title
is used. <literal remap="tt">newtOpenWindow*(</literal> is similar, but it requires a specific
location for the upper left-hand corner of the window.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Destroying Windows</title>

<para>
All windows are destroyed in the same manner, no matter how the windows
were originally created.


<screen>
void newtPopWindow(void);
</screen>


This function removes the top window from the display, and redraws the
display areas which the window overwrote.</para></sect2></sect1> 


<sect1><title>Components</title>

<para>
Components are the basic user interface element <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> provides. A
single component may be (for example) a listbox, push button checkbox,
a collection of other components. Most components are used to display
information in a window, provide a place for the user to enter data, or a
combination of these two functions. 

Forms, however, are a component whose primary purpose is not noticed by
the user at all. Forms are collections of components (a form may contain
another form) which logically relate the components to one another. Once
a form is created and had all of its constituent components added to it,
applications normally then run the form.  This gives control of the
application to the form, which then lets the user enter data onto the
form. When the user is done (a number of different events qualify as
``done''), the form returns control to the part of the application which
invoked it. The application may then read the information the user provided
and continue appropriately.

All <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> components are stored in a common data type, a
<literal remap="tt">newtComponent</literal> (some of the particulars of <literal remap="tt">newtComponent</literal>s have
already been mentioned. While this makes it easy for programmers to pass
components around, it does force them to make sure they don't pass
entry boxes to routines expecting push buttons, as the compiler can't
ensure that for them.

We start off with a brief introduction to forms. While not terribly
complete, this introduction is enough to let us illustrate the rest of
the components with some sample code. We'll then discuss the remainder of
the components, and end this section with a more exhaustive description of
forms.</para>


<sect2><title>Introduction to Forms</title>

<para>
As we've mentioned, forms are simply collections of components. As only one
form can be active (or running) at a time, every component which the user
should be able to access must be on the running form (or on a subform of
the running form). A form is itself a component, which means forms are
stored in <literal remap="tt">newtComponent</literal> data structures.


<screen>
newtComponent newtForm(newtComponent vertBar, const char * help, int flags);
</screen>


To create a form, call <literal remap="tt">newtForm()</literal>. The first parameter is a vertical
scrollbar which should be associated with the form. For now, that should
always be <literal remap="tt">NULL</literal> (we'll discuss how to create scrolling forms later in
this section). The second parameter, <literal remap="tt">help</literal>, is currently unused and
should always be <literal remap="tt">NULL</literal>. The <literal remap="tt">flags</literal> is normally 0, and other values
it can take will be discussed later. Now that we've waved away the
complexity of this function, creating a form boils down to simply:


<screen>
newtComponent myForm;

myForm = newtForm(NULL, NULL, 0);
</screen>


After a form is created, components need to be added to it --- after all,
an empty form isn't terribly useful. There are two functions which add
components to a form.


<screen>
void newtFormAddComponent(newtComponent form, newtComponent co);
void newtFormAddComponents(newtComponent form, ...);
</screen>


The first function, <literal remap="tt">newtFormAddComponent()</literal>, adds a single component
to the form which is passed as the first parameter. The second function
is simply a convenience function. After passing the form to
<literal remap="tt">newtFormAddComponents()</literal>, an arbitrary number of components is then
passed, followed by <literal remap="tt">NULL</literal>. Every component passed is added to the form.

Once a form has been created and components have been added to it, it's
time to run the form.


<screen>
newtComponent newtRunForm(newtComponent form);
</screen>


This function runs the form passed to it, and returns the component which
caused the form to stop running. For now, we'll ignore the return value
completely.

Notice that this function doesn't fit in with <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>'s normal
naming convention. It is an older interface which will not work for all
forms. It was left in <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> only for legacy applications. It is a
simpler interface than the new <literal remap="tt">newtFormRun()</literal> though, and is still used
quite often as a result.

When an application is done with a form, it destroys the form and
all of the components the form contains.


<screen>
void newtFormDestroy(newtComponent form);	
</screen>


This function frees the memory resources used by the form and all of the
components which have been added to the form (including those components
which are on subforms). Once a form has been destroyed, none of the form's
components can be used.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Components</title>

<para>
Non-form components are the most important user-interface component for
users. They determine how users interact with <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> and how information
is presented to them.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>General Component Manipulation</title>

<para>
There are a couple of functions which work on more then one type of
components. The description of each component indicates which (if any)
of these functions are valid for that particular component.


<screen>
typedef void (*newtCallback)(newtComponent, void *);

void newtComponentAddCallback(newtComponent co, newtCallback f, void * data);
void newtComponentTakesFocus(newtComponent co, int val);
</screen>


The first registers a callback function for that component. A callback
function is a function the application provides which <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> calls for a
particular component. Exactly when (if ever) the callback is invoked
depends on the type of component the callback is attached to, and will be
discussed for the components which support callbacks.

<literal remap="tt">newtComponentTakesFocus()</literal> works on all components. It allows the
application to change which components the user is allowed to select as the
current component, and hence provide input to. Components which do not
take focus are skipped over during form traversal, but they are displayed
on the terminal. Some components should never be set to take focus, such
as those which display static text.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Buttons</title>

<para>
Nearly all forms contain at least one button. <literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> buttons come in two
flavors, full buttons and compact buttons. Full buttons take up quit a bit
of screen space, but look much better then the single-row compact buttons.
Other then their size, both button styles behave identically. Different
functions are used to create the two types of buttons.


<screen>
newtComponent newtButton(int left, int top, const char * text);
newtComponent newtCompactButton(int left, int top, const char * text);
</screen>


Both functions take identical parameters. The first two parameters are the
location of the upper left corner of the button, and the final parameter is
the text which should be displayed in the button (such as ``Ok'' or
``Cancel'').</para>


<sect3><title>Button Example</title>

<para>
Here is a simple example of both full and compact buttons. It also
illustrates opening and closing windows, as well a simple form.


<screen>
#include &#60;newt.h&#62;
#include &#60;stdlib.h&#62;

void main(void) {
    newtComponent form, b1, b2;
    newtInit();
    newtCls();

    newtOpenWindow(10, 5, 40, 6, "Button Sample");

    b1 = newtButton(10, 1, "Ok");
    b2 = newtCompactButton(22, 2, "Cancel");
    form = newtForm(NULL, NULL, 0);
    newtFormAddComponents(form, b1, b2, NULL);

    newtRunForm(form);

    newtFormDestroy(form);
    newtFinished();
}
</screen></para></sect3></sect2>



<sect2><title>Labels</title>

<para>
Labels are <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>'s simplest component. They display some given text and
don't allow any user input.


<screen>
newtComponent newtLabel(int left, int top, const char * text);
void newtLabelSetText(newtComponent co, const char * text);
</screen>


Creating a label is just like creating a button; just pass the location of
the label and the text it should display. Unlike buttons, labels do let the
application change the text in the label with <literal remap="tt">newtLabelSetText</literal>. When
the label's text is changed, the label automatically redraws itself. It
does not clear out any old text which may be leftover from the previous
time is was displayed, however, so be sure that the new text is at least
as long as the old text.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Entry Boxes</title>

<para>
Entry boxes allow the user to enter a text string into the form which the
application can later retrieve.


<screen>
typedef int (*newtEntryFilter)(newtComponent entry, void * data, int ch,
			       int cursor);

newtComponent newtEntry(int left, int top, const char * initialValue, int width,
			char ** resultPtr, int flags);
void newtEntrySet(newtComponent co, const char * value, int cursorAtEnd);
char * newtEntryGetValue(newtComponent co);
void newtEntrySetFilter(newtComponent co, newtEntryFilter filter, void * data);
</screen></para>



<para>
<literal remap="tt">newtEntry()</literal> creates a new entry box. After the location of the entry
box, the initial value for the entry box is passed, which may be <literal remap="tt">NULL</literal>
if the box should start off empty. Next, the width of the physical box is
given. This width may or may not limit the length of the string the user is
allowed to enter; that depends on the <literal remap="tt">flags</literal>. The <literal remap="tt">resultPtr</literal> must
be the address of a <literal remap="tt">char *</literal>. Until the entry box is destroyed by
<literal remap="tt">newtFormDestroy()</literal>, that <literal remap="tt">char *</literal> will point to the current value
of the entry box. It's important that applications make a copy of that
value before destroying the form if they need to use it later. The
<literal remap="tt">resultPtr</literal> may be <literal remap="tt">NULL</literal>, in which case the user must use the
<literal remap="tt">newtEntryGetValue()</literal> function to get the value of the entry box.

Entry boxes support a number of flags:

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>NEWT_ENTRY_SCROLL</term>
<listitem>
<para>If this flag is not specified, the user cannot
enter text into the entry box which is wider then the entry box itself.
This flag removes this limitation, and lets the user enter data of an
arbitrary length.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>NEWT_FLAG_HIDDEN</term>
<listitem>
<para>If this flag is specified, the value of the entry box
is not displayed. This is useful when the application needs to read a
password, for example.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>NEWT_FLAG_RETURNEXIT</term>
<listitem>
<para>When this flag is given, the entry box will cause
the form to stop running if the user pressed return inside of the entry
box. This can provide a nice shortcut for users.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>


After an entry box has been created, its contents can be set by
<literal remap="tt">newtEntrySet()</literal>. After the entry box itself, the new string to place
in the entry box is passed. The final parameter, <literal remap="tt">cursorAtEnd</literal>, controls
where the cursor will appear in the entry box. If it is zero, the cursor
remains at its present location; a nonzero value moves the cursor to the
end of the entry box's new value.

While the simplest way to find the value of an entry box is by using a
<literal remap="tt">resultPtr</literal>, doing so complicates some applications.
<literal remap="tt">newtEntryGetValue()</literal> returns a pointer to the string which the entry
box currently contains. The returned pointer may not be valid once the
user further modifies the entry box, and will not be valid after the 
entry box has been destroyed, so be sure to save its value in a more
permanent location if necessary.

Entry boxes allow applications to filter characters as they are entered.
This allows programs to ignore characters which are invalid (such as
entering a ^ in the middle of a phone number) and provide intelligent aids
to the user (such as automatically adding a '.' after the user has typed in
the first three numbers in an IP address). 

When a filter is registered through <literal remap="tt">newtEntrySetFilter()</literal>, both the
filter itself and an arbitrary <literal remap="tt">void *</literal>, which passed to the filter
whenever it is invoked, are recorded. This data pointer isn't used for any
other purpose, and may be <literal remap="tt">NULL</literal>. Entry filters take four arguments.


<orderedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
The entry box which had data entered into it</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
The data pointer which was registered along with the filter</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
The new character which <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> is considering inserting into the
entry box</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
The current cursor position (0 is the leftmost position)
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

The filter returns 0 if the character should be ignored, or the value of
the character which should be inserted into the entry box. Filter functions
which want to do complex manipulations of the string should use
<literal remap="tt">newtEntrySet()</literal> to update the entry box and then return 0 to prevent
the new character from being inserted.

When a callback is attached to a entry box, the callback is invoked
whenever the user moves off of the callback and on to another component.

Here is a sample program which illustrates the use of both labels and
entry boxes.


<screen>
#include &#60;newt.h&#62;
#include &#60;stdlib.h&#62;
#include &#60;stdio.h&#62;

void main(void) {
    newtComponent form, label, entry, button;
    char * entryValue;

    newtInit();
    newtCls();

    newtOpenWindow(10, 5, 40, 8, "Entry and Label Sample");

    label = newtLabel(1, 1, "Enter a string");
    entry = newtEntry(16, 1, "sample", 20, &amp;entryValue, 
		      NEWT_FLAG_SCROLL | NEWT_FLAG_RETURNEXIT);
    button = newtButton(17, 3, "Ok");
    form = newtForm(NULL, NULL, 0);
    newtFormAddComponents(form, label, entry, button, NULL);

    newtRunForm(form);

    newtFinished();

    printf("Final string was: %s\n", entryValue);

    /* We cannot destroy the form until after we've used the value
       from the entry widget. */
    newtFormDestroy(form);
}
</screen></para></sect2>



<sect2><title>Checkboxes</title>

<para>
Most widget sets include checkboxes which toggle between two value (checked
or not checked). <literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> checkboxes are more flexible. When the user
presses the space bar on a checkbox, the checkbox's value changes to the
next value in an arbitrary sequence (which wraps). Most checkboxes have
two items in that sequence, checked or not, but <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> allows an
arbitrary number of value. This is useful when the user must pick from a
limited number of choices.

Each item in the sequence is a single character, and the sequence itself is
represented as a string. The checkbox components displays the character
which currently represents its value the left of a text label, and returns
the same character as its current value. The default sequence for
checkboxes is <literal remap="tt">" *"</literal>, with <literal remap="tt">' '</literal> indicating false and <literal remap="tt">'*'</literal> true.


<screen>
newtComponent newtCheckbox(int left, int top, const char * text, char defValue,
			   const char * seq, char * result);
char newtCheckboxGetValue(newtComponent co);
</screen></para>



<para>
Like most components, the position of the checkbox is the first thing
passed to the function that creates one. The next parameter, <literal remap="tt">text</literal>, is
the text which is displayed to the right of the area which is checked.  The
<literal remap="tt">defValue</literal> is the initial value for the checkbox, and <literal remap="tt">seq</literal> is the
sequence which the checkbox should go through (<literal remap="tt">defValue</literal> must be
in <literal remap="tt">seq</literal>. <literal remap="tt">seq</literal> may be <literal remap="tt">NULL</literal>, in which case <literal remap="tt">" *"</literal> is used.
The final parameter, <literal remap="tt">result</literal>, should point to a character which the
checkbox should always record its current value in. If <literal remap="tt">result</literal> is
<literal remap="tt">NULL</literal>, <literal remap="tt">newtCheckboxGetValue()</literal> must be used to get the current
value of the checkbox.

<literal remap="tt">newtCheckboxGetValue()</literal> is straightforward, returning the character
in the sequence which indicates the current value of the checkbox

If a callback is attached to a checkbox, the callback is invoked whenever
the checkbox responds to a user's keystroke. The entry box may respond by
taking focus or giving up focus, as well as by changing its current value.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Radio Buttons</title>

<para>
Radio buttons look very similar to checkboxes. The key difference between
the two is that radio buttons are grouped into sets, and exactly one radio
button in that set may be turned on. If another radio button is selected,
the button which was selected is automatically deselected.



<screen>
newtComponent newtRadiobutton(int left, int top, const char * text, 
			      int isDefault, newtComponent prevButton);
newtComponent newtRadioGetCurrent(newtComponent setMember);
</screen>


Each radio button is created by calling <literal remap="tt">newtRadiobutton()</literal>. After
the position of the radio button, the text displayed with the button
is passed. <literal remap="tt">isDefault</literal> should be nonzero if the radio button is to
be turned on by default. The final parameter, <literal remap="tt">prevMember</literal> is used
to group radio buttons into sets. If <literal remap="tt">prevMember</literal> is <literal remap="tt">NULL</literal>, the 
radio button is assigned to a new set. If the radio button should belong
to a preexisting set, <literal remap="tt">prevMember</literal> must be the previous radio button
added to that set.

Discovering which radio button in a set is currently selected necessitates
<literal remap="tt">newtRadioGetCurrent()</literal>. It may be passed any radio button in the set
you're interested in, and it returns the radio button component currently
selected.

Here is an example of both checkboxes and radio buttons.


<screen>
#include &#60;newt.h&#62;
#include &#60;stdlib.h&#62;
#include &#60;stdio.h&#62;

void main(void) {
    newtComponent form, checkbox, rb[3], button;
    char cbValue;
    int i;

    newtInit();
    newtCls();

    newtOpenWindow(10, 5, 40, 11, "Checkboxes and Radio buttons");

    checkbox = newtCheckbox(1, 1, "A checkbox", ' ', " *X", &amp;cbValue);

    rb[0] = newtRadiobutton(1, 3, "Choice 1", 1, NULL);
    rb[1] = newtRadiobutton(1, 4, "Choice 2", 0, rb[0]);
    rb[2] = newtRadiobutton(1, 5, "Choice 3", 0, rb[1]);

    button = newtButton(1, 7, "Ok");

    form = newtForm(NULL, NULL, 0);
    newtFormAddComponent(form, checkbox);
    for (i = 0; i &#60; 3; i++)
	newtFormAddComponent(form, rb[i]);
    newtFormAddComponent(form, button);

    newtRunForm(form);
    newtFinished();

    /* We cannot destroy the form until after we've found the current
       radio button */

    for (i = 0; i &#60; 3; i++)
	if (newtRadioGetCurrent(rb[0]) == rb[i])
	    printf("radio button picked: %d\n", i);
    newtFormDestroy(form);

    /* But the checkbox's value is stored locally */
    printf("checkbox value: '%c'\n", cbValue);
}
</screen></para></sect2>



<sect2><title>Scales</title>

<para>
It's common for programs to need to display a progress meter on the
terminal while it performs some length operation (it behaves like an
anesthetic). The scale component is a simple way of doing this. It
displays a horizontal bar graph which the application can update as the
operation continues.


<screen>
newtComponent newtScale(int left, int top, int width, long long fullValue);
void newtScaleSet(newtComponent co, unsigned long long amount);
</screen>


When the scale is created with <literal remap="tt">newtScale</literal>, it is given the width of the
scale itself as well as the value which means that the scale should be
drawn as full. When the position of the scale is set with
<literal remap="tt">newtScaleSet()</literal>, the scale is told the amount of the scale which should
be filled in relative to the <literal remap="tt">fullAmount</literal>. For example, if the
application is copying a file, <literal remap="tt">fullValue</literal> could be the number of bytes
in the file, and when the scale is updated <literal remap="tt">newtScaleSet()</literal> would be
passed the number of bytes which have been copied so far.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Textboxes</title>

<para>
Textboxes display a block of text on the terminal, and is appropriate for
display large amounts of text. 


<screen>
newtComponent newtTextbox(int left, int top, int width, int height, int flags);
void newtTextboxSetText(newtComponent co, const char * text);
</screen>


<literal remap="tt">newtTextbox()</literal> creates a new textbox, but does not fill it with data.
The function is passed the location for the textbox on the screen, the
width and height of the textbox (in characters), and zero or more of the
following flags:

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>NEWT_FLAG_WRAP</term>
<listitem>
<para>All text in the textbox should be wrapped to fit
the width of the textbox. If this flag is not specified, each newline
delimited line in the text is truncated if it is too long to fit.

When <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> wraps text, it tries not to break lines on spaces or tabs.
Literal newline characters are respected, and may be used to force line
breaks.</para>
<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>NEWT_FLAG_SCROLL</term>
<listitem>
<para>The text box should be scrollable. When this option
is used, the scrollbar which is added increases the width of the area used
by the textbox by 2 characters; that is the textbox is 2 characters wider
then the width passed to <literal remap="tt">newtTextbox()</literal>.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>



<para>
After a textbox has been created, text may be added to it through
<literal remap="tt">newtTextboxSetText()</literal>, which takes only the textbox and the new text as
parameters. If the textbox already contained text, that text is replaced by
the new text. The textbox makes its own copy of the passed text, so these
is no need to keep the original around unless it's convenient.</para></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist></para>


<sect3><title>Reflowing Text</title>

<para>
When applications need to display large amounts of text, it's common not to
know exactly where the linebreaks should go. While textboxes are quite
willing to scroll the text, the programmer still must know what width the
text will look ``best'' at (where ``best'' means most exactly rectangular;
no lines much shorter or much longer then the rest). This common is
especially prevalent in internationalized programs, which need to make a
wide variety of message string look god on a screen.

To help with this, <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> provides routines to reformat text to look
good. It tries different widths to figure out which one will look ``best''
to the user. As these commons are almost always used to format text for
textbox components, <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> makes it easy to construct a textbox with
reflowed text.


<screen>
char * newtReflowText(char * text, int width, int flexDown, int flexUp,
		      int * actualWidth, int * actualHeight);
newtComponent newtTextboxReflowed(int left, int top, char * text, int width,
				  int flexDown, int flexUp, int flags);
int newtTextboxGetNumLines(newtComponent co);
</screen></para>



<para>
<literal remap="tt">newtReflowText()</literal> reflows the <literal remap="tt">text</literal> to a target width of
<literal remap="tt">width</literal>. The actual width of the longest line in the returned string is
between <literal remap="tt">width - flexDown</literal> and <literal remap="tt">width + flexUp</literal>; the actual maximum
line length is chosen to make the displayed check look rectangular. 
The <literal remap="tt">int</literal>s pointed to by <literal remap="tt">actualWidth</literal> and <literal remap="tt">actualHeight</literal> are set
to the width of the longest line and the number of lines in in the
returned text, respectively. Either one may be <literal remap="tt">NULL</literal>. The return
value points to the reflowed text, and is allocated through <literal remap="tt">malloc()</literal>.

When the reflowed text is being placed in a textbox it may be easier to use
<literal remap="tt">newtTextboxReflowed()</literal>, which creates a textbox, reflows the text, and
places the reflowed text in the listbox. It's parameters consist of the
position of the final textbox, the width and flex values for the text
(which are identical to the parameters passed to <literal remap="tt">newtReflowText()</literal>,
and the flags for the textbox (which are the same as the flags for
<literal remap="tt">newtTextbox()</literal>. This function does not let you limit the height of the
textbox, however, making limiting it's use to constructing textboxes which
don't need to scroll.

To find out how tall the textbox created by <literal remap="tt">newtTextboxReflowed()</literal> is, 
use <literal remap="tt">newtTextboxGetNumLines()</literal>, which returns the number of lines in the
textbox. For textboxes created by <literal remap="tt">newtTextboxReflowed()</literal>, this is
always the same as the height of the textbox.

Here's a simple program which uses a textbox to display a message.


<screen>
#include &#60;newt.h&#62;
#include &#60;stdlib.h&#62;

char message[] = "This is a pretty long message. It will be displayed "
		 "in a newt textbox, and illustrates how to construct "
		 "a textbox from arbitrary text which may not have "
		 "very good line breaks.\n\n"
		 "Notice how literal \\n characters are respected, and "
		 "may be used to force line breaks and blank lines.";

void main(void) {
    newtComponent form, text, button;

    newtInit();
    newtCls();

    text = newtTextboxReflowed(1, 1, message, 30, 5, 5, 0);
    button = newtButton(12, newtTextboxGetNumLines(text) + 2, "Ok");

    newtOpenWindow(10, 5, 37,
		   newtTextboxGetNumLines(text) + 7, "Textboxes");

    form = newtForm(NULL, NULL, 0);
    newtFormAddComponents(form, text, button, NULL);

    newtRunForm(form);
    newtFormDestroy(form);
    newtFinished();
}
</screen></para></sect3></sect2>



<sect2><title>Scrollbars</title>

<para>
Scrollbars (which, currently, are always vertical in <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>), may be
attached to forms to let them contain more data then they have space for.
While the actual process of making scrolling forms is discussed at the end 
of this section, we'll go ahead and introduce scrollbars now so you'll be
ready.


<screen>
newtComponent newtVerticalScrollbar(int left, int top, int height,
				    int normalColorset, int thumbColorset);
</screen>


When a scrollbar is created, it is given a position on the screen, a
height, and two colors. The first color is the color used for drawing the
scrollbar, and the second color is used for drawing the thumb. This is the
only place in newt where an application specifically sets colors for a
component. It's done here to let the colors a scrollbar use match the
colors of the component the scrollbar is mated too. When a scrollbar is
being used with a form, <literal remap="tt">normalColorset</literal> is often
<literal remap="tt">NEWT_COLORSET_WINDOW</literal> and <literal remap="tt">thumbColorset</literal>
<literal remap="tt">NEWT_COLORSET_ACTCHECKBOX</literal>. Of course, feel free to peruse
<literal remap="tt">&lt;newt.h&gt;</literal> and pick your own colors.

As the scrollbar is normally updated by the component it is mated with,
there is no public interface for moving the thumb.</para></sect2>


<sect2><title>Listboxes</title>
<para>
Listboxes are the most complicated components 
<literal remap="tt">newt</literal> provides. They can
allow a single selection or multiple selection, and are easy to update.
Unfortunately, their API is also the least consistent of <literal remap="tt">newt</literal>'s
components. Each entry in a listbox is a ordered pair of the text which should be
displayed for that item and a <emphasis remap="bf">key</emphasis>, which is a <literal remap="tt">void *</literal> that
uniquely identifies that listbox item. Many applications pass integers in
as keys, but using arbitrary pointers makes many applications significantly
easier to code.</para>

<sect3><title>Basic Listboxes</title>

<para>
Let's start off by looking at the most important listbox functions.


<screen>
newtComponent newtListbox(int left, int top, int height, int flags);
int newtListboxAppendEntry(newtComponent co, const char * text, 
			   const void * data);
void * newtListboxGetCurrent(newtComponent co);
void newtListboxSetWidth(newtComponent co, int width);
void newtListboxSetCurrent(newtComponent co, int num);
void newtListboxSetCurrentByKey(newtComponent co, void * key);
</screen></para>



<para>
A listbox is created at a certain position and a given height. The
<literal remap="tt">height</literal> is used for two things. First of all, it is the minimum
height the listbox will use. If there are less items in the listbox then
the height, suggests the listbox will still take up that minimum amount
of space. Secondly, if the listbox is set to be scrollable (by setting
the <literal remap="tt">NEWT_FLAG_SCROLL flag</literal>, the <literal remap="tt">height</literal> is also the maximum height
of the listbox. If the listbox may not scroll, it increases its height to
display all of its items.

The following flags may be used when creating a listbox:

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>NEWT_FLAG_SCROLL</term>
<listitem>
<para>The listbox should scroll to display all of the
items it contains.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>NEWT_FLAG_RETURNEXIT</term>
<listitem>
<para>When the user presses return on an item in the
list, the form should return.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>NEWT_FLAG_BORDER</term>
<listitem>
<para>A frame is drawn around the listbox, which can make
it easier to see which listbox has the focus when a form contains multiple
listboxes.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>NEWT_FLAG_MULTIPLE</term>
<listitem>
<para>By default, a listbox only lets the user select
one item in the list at a time. When this flag is specified, they may
select multiple items from the list.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist></para>


<para>
Once a listbox has been created, items are added to it by invoking
<literal remap="tt">newtListboxAppendEntry()</literal>, which adds new items to the end of the list.
In addition to the listbox component, <literal remap="tt">newtListboxAppendEntry()</literal> needs
both elements of the (text, key) ordered pair. 

For lists which only allow a single selection, <literal remap="tt">newtListboxGetCurrent()</literal>
should be used to find out which listbox item is currently selected. It
returns the key of the currently selected item.

Normally, a listbox is as wide as its widest element, plus space for a
scrollbar if the listbox is supposed to have one. To make the listbox
any larger then that, use <literal remap="tt">newtListboxSetWidth()</literal>, which overrides the
natural list of the listbox. Once the width has been set, it's fixed. The
listbox will no longer grow to accommodate new entries, so bad things may
happen! 

An application can change the current position of the listbox (where the
selection bar is displayed) by calling <literal remap="tt">newtListboxSetCurrent()</literal> or
<literal remap="tt">newtListboxSetCurrentByKey()</literal>. The first sets the current position to the
entry number which is passed as the second argument, with 0 indicating
the first entry. <literal remap="tt">newtListboxSetCurrentByKey()</literal> sets the current position
to the entry whose <literal remap="tt">key</literal> is passed into the function.</para></sect3>


<sect3><title>Manipulating Listbox Contents</title>

<para>
While the contents of many listboxes never need to change, some applications
need to change the contents of listboxes regularly. <literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> includes
complete support for updating listboxes. These new functions are in
addition to <literal remap="tt">newtListboxAppendEntry()</literal>, which was already discussed.


<screen>
void newtListboxSetEntry(newtComponent co, void * key, const char * text);
int newtListboxInsertEntry(newtComponent co, const char * text, 
                           const void * data, void * key);
int newtListboxDeleteEntry(newtComponent co, void * key);
void newtListboxClear(newtComponent co);
</screen></para>



<para>
The first of these, <literal remap="tt">newtListboxSetEntry()</literal>, updates the text for a
key which is already in the listbox. The <literal remap="tt">key</literal> specifies which listbox
entry should be modified, and <literal remap="tt">text</literal> becomes the new text for that entry
in the listbox.

<literal remap="tt">newtListboxInsertEntry()</literal> inserts a new listbox entry <emphasis remap="bf">after</emphasis> an
already existing entry, which is specified by the <literal remap="tt">key</literal> parameter.
The <literal remap="tt">text</literal> and <literal remap="tt">data</literal> parameters specify the new entry which should
be added.

Already-existing entries are removed from a listbox with
<literal remap="tt">newtListboxDeleteEntry()</literal>. It removes the listbox entry with the
specified <literal remap="tt">key</literal>. If you want to remove all of the entries from a
listbox, use <literal remap="tt">newtListboxClear()</literal>.</para></sect3> 


<sect3><title>Multiple Selections</title>

<para>
When a listbox is created with <literal remap="tt">NEWT_FLAG_MULTIPLE</literal>, the user can select
multiple items from the list. When this option is used, a different set of
functions must be used to manipulate the listbox selection.


<screen>
void newtListboxClearSelection(newtComponent co);
void **newtListboxGetSelection(newtComponent co, int *numitems);
void newtListboxSelectItem(newtComponent co, const void * key,
	                   enum newtFlagsSense sense);
</screen>


The simplest of these is <literal remap="tt">newtListboxClearSelection()</literal>, which deselects
all of the items in the list (listboxes which allow multiple selections
also allow zero selections). <literal remap="tt">newtListboxGetSelection()</literal> returns a
pointer to an array which contains the keys for all of the items in the
listbox currently selected. The <literal remap="tt">int</literal> pointed to by <literal remap="tt">numitems</literal> is
set to the number of items currently selected (and hence the number of
items in the returned array). The returned array is dynamically allocated,

<literal remap="tt">newtListboxSelectItem()</literal> lets the program select and deselect specific
listbox entries. The <literal remap="tt">key</literal> of the listbox entry is being affected is
passed, and <literal remap="tt">sense</literal> is one of <literal remap="tt">NEWT_FLAGS_RESET</literal>, which deselects
the entry, <literal remap="tt">NEWT_FLAGS_SET</literal>, which selects the entry, or

<sect2><title>Advanced Forms</title>

<para>
Forms, which tie components together, are quite important in the world of
<literal remap="tt">newt</literal>. While we've already discussed the basics of forms, we've omitted
many of the details.</para>


<sect3><title>Exiting From Forms</title>

<para>
Forms return control to the application for a number of reasons:


<itemizedlist>
<listitem>

<para>
A component can force the form to exit. Buttons do this whenever they
are pushed, and other components exit when <literal remap="tt">NEWT_FLAG_RETURNEXIT</literal> has
been specified.</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
Applications can setup hot keys which cause the form to exit when
they are pressed.</para></listitem>
<listitem>

<para>
<literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> can exit when file descriptors are ready to be read or
ready to be written to.
</para>
</listitem></itemizedlist>

By default, <literal remap="tt">newt</literal> forms exit when the F12 key is pressed (F12 is setup
as a hot key by default). <literal remap="tt">Newt</literal> applications should treat F12 as an
``Ok'' button. If applications don't want F12 to exit the form, they can
specify <literal remap="tt">NEWT_FLAG_NOF12</literal> as flag when creating the form with 
<literal remap="tt">newtForm</literal>.
